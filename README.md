# SuperMarket-Application-

Overview


    Grocery Store Application is the simple console system which manages the sales
activity done in a supermarket or Store, maintaining the stock details, maintaining the
records of the sales done. These aspects involve managing information about the
various products, billing etc. This application provides an efficient way of managing the
grocery store information. This project is based on the sales transaction and billing of
items in a grocery store.

    The first activity is based on adding the items to the system along with the rate which
are present in the grocery store and the name of the items which the store will agree to
sell. Any modifications to be done in the item name and the rate can be done only by an
admin. The admin also has the right to delete any item.

    As a buyer one can see the list of available items in this store. Then after buying any
products one can calculate total bill information.
